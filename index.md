##### About Me
* * *

I recently completed my PhD at New York University under the guidance of [Prof. Yi Fang](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/yi-fang){:target="_blank"}. My research focuses on computer vision with a particular emphasis on fairness, foundational models, diffusion models, LLMs, medical imaging, and self-supervised learning.

During my PhD, I had the opportunity to gain valuable research experience as a visiting researcher at the [Harvard Ophthalmology AI Lab](https://ophai.hms.harvard.edu/){:target="_blank"} at Harvard Medical School. Additionally, I acquired industry experience as a Machine Learning Research Scientist intern at the [Bosch Center for AI](https://www.bosch-ai.com/).

I welcome opportunities for collaboration and intellectual exchange. Whether you're interested in joint research, discussing ideas, or seeking advice on the PhD journey, please don't hesitate to get in touch.

##### Previously
* * * 
Before NYU, I obtained a B.S in Electrical Engineering from NYU Abu Dhabi where my undergraduate thesis was on lane detection for autonomous vehicles. During high school, I represented the national team in [International Mathematical Olympiad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Mathematical_Olympiad){:target="_blank"}.
