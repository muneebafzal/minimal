##### About Me
* * *

I am a PhD student at New York University where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yi Fang](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/yi-fang){:target="_blank"}. My research focuses computer vision with a particular emphasis on foundational models, diffusion models, LLMs, medical imaging, and self-supervised learning.

##### Previously
* * * 
Before NYU, I obtained a B.S in Electrical Engineering from NYU Abu Dhabi where my undergraduate thesis was on lane detection for autonomous vehicles. During high school, I represented the national team in [International Mathematical Olympiad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Mathematical_Olympiad){:target="_blank"}.
